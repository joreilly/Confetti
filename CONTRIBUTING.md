## Dev environment

At the time of writing, in order to build the Confetti app, you'll need:

* JDK 17+, you can get one with [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/zulu) on macOS or with you favorite package manager.
* Android Studio Electric Eel or higher. 
* Xcode 14.2+ for the iOS app


## Mobile & watch apps
For Android, open the root project in Android Studio. Useful tasks:

* `./gradlew :androidApp:assembleDebug` 
* `./gradlew :wearApp:assembleDebug` 

For iOS, open the `iosApp/iosApp.xcodeproj` in Xcode and run the app.

## API docs 

API docs are available at [backend/README.md](backend/README.md)

## Backend

You can run the backend locally with the following task:

* `./gradle :backend:service-graphql:bootRun` 

When running `bootRun`, you will only be able to use the "test" conference as access to the real data requires additional credentials.


Happy hacking!
